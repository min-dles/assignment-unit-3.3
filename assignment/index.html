      <li>Regarding questions 6 and 7 on this assignment, I am confused about values that are numbers in an array. As a best practice, should we enter numbers in an array as string variables instead? I noticed that this was an issue on questions 6 and 7 when it would indicate "removed X parts" because the number shows in the console as a negative number, rather than "Removed 6 parts" it says "Removed -6 parts".</li>
      <li>In general, I would love more information on the nuances between For Of and For In loops, when to use which one, etc.</li>
      <li>I'm wondering if there is an important difference when we should use // to comment in JavaScript, versus /* */? I prefer the latter for longer comments and would like to know if this is okay. Thanks!</li>
